# Riemann Surfaces

I'm trying to recreate something I did in school.
https://www.trade-ideas.com/home/phil/loops/
That code doesn't want to run any more, so I'm redoing it in JavaScript (TypeScript).

This is a way of graphing a function with complex inputs and outputs.
It is especially useful for multi-valued functions.
E.g. ∜16 = 2 __and__ -2.
If you believe in imaginary numbers, it __also__ equals 2𝓲 and -2𝓲.
