# Riemann Surfaces

I'm trying to recreate something I did in school.
https://www.trade-ideas.com/home/phil/loops/
That code doesn't want to run any more, so I'm redoing it in JavaScript (TypeScript).

This is a way of graphing a function with complex inputs and outputs.
It is especially useful for multi-valued functions.
E.g. ∜16 = 2 **and** -2.
If you believe in imaginary numbers, it **also** equals 2𝓲 and -2𝓲.

## Terminology

For a given 𝒛 there can be multiple 𝒘's.
For a given 𝒘 there can be only one 𝒛.
E.g. 𝒛=𝒘².

## Keywords
