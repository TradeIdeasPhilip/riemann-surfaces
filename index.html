      <h1>Demo</h1>
      <h2>Circles and Roots</h2>
      <p>
        If ùíõ rotates around the origin, ‚àöùíõ will move in the same direction but
        half as far. That explains why there are two values for ‚àöùíõ.
      </p>
      <button id="showMeCirclesAndRoots">Show me</button>
      <p>
        Half way through the demo, this program swapped the colors of the two
        outputs, because of the path. However, any input will always produce the
        same two output values, regardless of the path.
      </p>
      <h2>Branch Cuts</h2>
      <p>
        What if we didn't save the path? What if we only knew the current input?
        One way to deal with this is to make a cut in the complex plane. We can
        see if this if we move the input without saving any previous values.
      </p>
      <button id="showMeBranchCuts1">Show me</button>
      <p>
        As soon as the user saves a point, we automatically move the branch cut
        as far from that point as possible.
      </p>
      <button id="showMeBranchCuts2">Show me</button>
      <h2>Squares and Straight Lines</h2>
      <p>Let's draw four points to make a square.</p>
      <button id="showMeSquare1">Show me</button>
      <p>
        The output made an octagon. But this is just a rough estimate. Let's try
        again with twice as many points.
      </p>
      <button id="showMeSquare2">Show me</button>
      <p>
        Notice how the lines bow inwards and the angles have gotten smaller.
        Let's try again with a lot more points.
      </p>
      <button id="showMeSquare3">Show me</button>
      <p>
        Since the input made right angles, the outputs should also make right
        angles. In calculus terminology, this function is a "conformal" or angle
        preserving mapping.
      </p>
      <h2>Conformal Mapping</h2>
      <p>Let's try that same trick with an equilateral triangle.</p>
      <button id="showMeEquilateralTriangle">Show me</button>
      <p>
        As with the square, the outputs of the function make the same angles as
        the input. In this case they are all 60¬∞.
      </p>
      <p>Let's try that same trick with a 30¬∞ 60¬∞ 90¬∞ triangle.</p>
      <button id="showMeRightTriangle">Show me</button>
      <p>
        Once again, the outputs of the function make the same angles as the
        input.
      </p>
      <h2>Natural Logarithm</h2>
      <p>
        The natural log makes the most sense if think of the input in polar
        coordinates. The real part of the answer is based on the distance
        between the origin and the input. The imaginary part of the answer is
        based on the angle between the input and the positive real axis at the
        origin.
      </p>
      <button id="showMeLog1">Show me</button>
      <p>
        As the input approaches the branch point, the outputs all approach
        infinity. In complex analysis we say there is only one infinity. So all
        of the outputs would have the same value if the input was the branch
        point.
